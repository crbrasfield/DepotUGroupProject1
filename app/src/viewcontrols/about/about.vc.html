            <h3>The game within the game.</h3>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <p>CoverSharks was founded by a group of college football fans who have been playing a fantasy sports game called
                "Pick Six" for over a decade. As an alum and avid fan of the Crimson Tide, Bill Wilder first created the
                original concept behind the game app in 2006. The ida was simple... give friends and college football fans
                alike the opportunity to engage in their favorite sport using an innovative format of game play that engages
                them in a unique, "game within the game" competition and enhances the overall entertainment experience.
